            <section>
                <p>Crypto content moves fast. Protocols launch, markets shift, and technical details matter. You need an editor who understands blockchain mechanics well enough to catch errors in protocol explanations, verify tokenomics claims, and maintain accuracy across market cycles.</p>
                <p>I've been editing crypto content weekly for DSS Digital since 2022. That's 30+ continuous months covering DeFi protocols, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency markets. Beyond editing, I've managed 30+ token launch campaigns coordinating teams of 4–8 writers and building AI content systems at scale.</p>

                <p>My Computer Science background means I can verify technical claims about consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and on-chain data, not just polish the grammar.</p>

                    <h3>Allcaps / DSS Media</h3>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Project Manager & Senior Writer (2022–2025)</p>
                    <p><strong>Scale:</strong> 30+ token launch campaigns, 2,500+ articles managed</p>

                    <p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Managed teams of 4–8 writers across 5–10 simultaneous campaigns at peak capacity</li>
                        <li>Built AI-assisted content pipelines (Airtable workflows, GPT drafting with human quality control)</li>
                        <li>Coordinated programmatic SEO campaigns (largest: 1,131 articles for single project)</li>
                        <li>Developed project-specific style guides, competitor analysis, and positioning strategies</li>
                        <li>Tracked payments, deadlines, and quality assurance across multi-writer teams</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Campaign categories</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>DeFi and trading platforms (8+ campaigns)</li>
                        <li>Gaming and metaverse projects (6+ campaigns)</li>
                        <li>Community and meme tokens (10+ campaigns)</li>
                        <li>Infrastructure and utility tokens (5+ campaigns)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Operational capabilities demonstrated</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High-volume coordination: 5–10 active projects simultaneously</li>
                        <li>Programmatic SEO: 1,000+ article campaigns with keyword targeting</li>
                        <li>AI pipeline integration: Custom workflows with quality gates</li>
                        <li>Multi-phase campaigns: Pre-launch, token launch, post-listing, long-term maintenance</li>
                        <li>Multi-language coordination: Translation management, cross-cultural adaptation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Important context:</strong> Crypto token projects are inherently high-risk — the majority of projects in this portfolio failed post-launch or were abandoned. The value demonstrated here is operational capacity, content systems, and team management at scale. Success in this sector is measured by content delivery, team coordination, and process excellence, not token performance.</p>
