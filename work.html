                    <h3>Trading with Rayner Teo</h3>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Editor, Options Trading Niche &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2023–2025</p>

                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>Rayner Teo runs one of the top-15 trading education blogs globally, with an audience of 210,000+ followers. I joined as lead editor with a focus on the options trading niche — the most technically demanding content the platform produces.</p>

                    <p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Edited and ghostwrote 500+ articles across options trading, technical analysis, chart patterns, trading psychology, and risk management</li>
                        <li>Verified mathematical frameworks — expectancy calculations, position sizing formulas, backtested strategy results, and option greeks</li>
                        <li>Reviewed and improved pedagogical structure, ensuring complex concepts were accessible to retail traders without sacrificing accuracy</li>
                        <li>Maintained consistency across a high-volume editorial calendar</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why it mattered</strong></p>
                    <p>Trading education content that gets the maths wrong damages credibility with exactly the audience that knows better. The editorial standard here required both genuine domain knowledge and the ability to write clearly for learners — not just one or the other.</p>

                    <h3>DSS Digital</h3>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Crypto Content Editor &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2022–Present (30+ months)</p>

                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>An ongoing weekly crypto editing engagement now in its third year. DSS Digital operates in a space where technical accuracy and speed both matter — blockchain mechanics shift quickly, and errors in protocol descriptions or market analysis reflect badly on the platform.</p>

                    <p><strong>What I do</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weekly editing across cryptocurrency market analysis, DeFi protocol coverage, and blockchain explainers</li>
                        <li>Technical accuracy verification for protocol mechanics, tokenomics, and on-chain data</li>
                        <li>Editorial consistency across a team of writers with varying levels of crypto expertise</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                    <p>30+ months of continuous engagement in crypto content is a signal in itself. The space is fast-moving and demanding. Sustained reliability here demonstrates both technical competence and editorial consistency over time.</p>

                    <h3>Traffic Lab</h3>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> LLM Specialist & Workflow Architect &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2022–Present (36+ months)</p>

                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>Traffic Lab operates in iGaming, a compliance-heavy vertical where content must meet regulatory standards while scaling to high volume. Over three years, my role evolved from editor to workflow architect — designing the AI systems that now underpin their content operation.</p>

                    <p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed and iterated on AI-augmented casino review systems, moving from custom GPT to a two-stage Gemini Deep Research pipeline</li>
                        <li>Built quality control frameworks: accuracy checks, anti-plagiarism protocols, regulatory compliance verification</li>
                        <li>Developed prompt engineering standards and editorial review layers for AI-generated content</li>
                        <li>Created documentation and systems that reduced per-article production time while maintaining compliance standards</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                    <p>This engagement represents the shift from content delivery to content systems. Building a pipeline that consistently produces compliant, accurate iGaming content at scale — and maintaining it across three years of LLM evolution — required both technical architecture skills and deep editorial judgement.</p>

                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Proofreader &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 21 months</p>
                    <p>Sustained proofreading engagement across a 21-month period, demonstrating the kind of long-term reliability that characterises all my client relationships.</p>

                    <h3>Berlitz</h3>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> AI Prompt Engineer &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> Project engagement</p>

                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>Berlitz is one of the world's most established language education organisations, operating in 70+ countries. This engagement focused on AI prompt engineering for their language tutor LLM — designing prompts that produce accurate, pedagogically sound language instruction at scale.</p>

                    <p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed and refined prompts for Berlitz's language tutor LLM to improve instruction quality and consistency</li>
                        <li>Applied knowledge of pedagogy and language learning to shape AI behaviour toward effective teaching outcomes</li>
                        <li>Iterated on prompt structures to balance naturalness, accuracy, and learner-appropriate tone</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                    <p>Prompt engineering for an educational LLM at Berlitz's scale requires both technical precision and genuine understanding of how people learn. This engagement sits squarely at the intersection of AI workflow expertise and the pedagogical background I've built over 13+ years of language education.</p>
