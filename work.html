                    <h3>Trading with Rayner Teo</h3>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Editor, Options Trading Niche &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2023–Present</p>

                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>Rayner Teo runs one of the top-15 trading education blogs globally, with an audience of 210,000+ followers. I work as lead editor with a focus on the options trading niche, which is the most technically demanding content the platform produces.</p>

                    <p><strong>What I do</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Edit across options trading, technical analysis, chart patterns, trading psychology, and risk management (500+ articles to date)</li>
                        <li>Verify mathematical frameworks: expectancy calculations, position sizing formulas, backtested strategy results, and option greeks</li>
                        <li>Review and improve pedagogical structure, ensuring complex concepts are accessible to retail traders without sacrificing accuracy</li>
                        <li>Maintain consistency across a high-volume editorial calendar</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                    <p>Trading education content that gets the maths wrong damages credibility with exactly the audience that knows better. The editorial standard here requires both genuine domain knowledge and the ability to write clearly for learners — not just one or the other.</p>

                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Crypto Content Editor &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2022–Present (30+ months)</p>

                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>An ongoing weekly crypto editing engagement now in its third year. DSS Digital operates in a space where technical accuracy and speed both matter. Blockchain mechanics shift quickly, and errors in protocol descriptions or market analysis reflect badly on the platform.</p>

                    <p><strong>What I do</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weekly editing across cryptocurrency market analysis, DeFi protocol coverage, and blockchain explainers</li>
                        <li>Technical accuracy verification for protocol mechanics, tokenomics, and on-chain data</li>
                        <li>Editorial consistency across a team of writers with varying levels of crypto expertise</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                    <p>30+ months of continuous engagement in crypto content is a signal in itself. The space is fast-moving and demanding. Sustained reliability here demonstrates both technical competence and editorial consistency over time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> LLM Specialist & Workflow Architect &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2022–Present (36+ months)</p>

                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                    <p>Traffic Lab operates in iGaming, a compliance-heavy vertical where content must meet regulatory standards while scaling to high volume. Over three years, my role evolved from editor to workflow architect, where I designed the AI systems that now underpin their content operation.</p>

                    <p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed and iterated on AI-augmented casino review systems, moving from custom GPT to a two-stage Gemini Deep Research pipeline</li>
                        <li>Built quality control frameworks: accuracy checks, anti-plagiarism protocols, regulatory compliance verification</li>
                        <li>Developed prompt engineering standards and editorial review layers for AI-generated content</li>
                        <li>Created documentation and systems that reduced per-article production time while maintaining compliance standards</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>
                    <p>Building a pipeline that consistently produces compliant, accurate iGaming content at scale, and maintaining it across three years of LLM evolution, required both technical architecture skills and deep editorial judgement.</p>
